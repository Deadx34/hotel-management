üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Design Principles
This project was built with a specific set of modern technologies and design principles to ensure performance, responsiveness, and visual appeal without relying on common SVG-based libraries.

Frontend:

HTML5: The core structure of the single-page application.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling, layout, and responsiveness, enabling a utility-first approach that keeps the design clean and maintainable.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, data handling, and chart initialization.

Data Visualization:

Chart.js: Used exclusively for all charts (Line, Doughnut, Bar, Stacked Bar). All charts are rendered to HTML Canvas elements, ensuring high performance and avoiding SVG. The implementation includes:

Full responsiveness to fit container dimensions.

Custom logic for wrapping long labels to maintain readability.

Customized tooltips for an enhanced user experience.

Design & Development Philosophy:

Single-Page Application (SPA): The content is presented in a single file to create a seamless, narrative-driven experience for the user, guiding them through the data story from top to bottom.

Material Design Aesthetics: The UI incorporates principles like elevation (shadows), clear typography, and a card-based layout to create a modern and professional feel.

No SVG / No Mermaid JS: A core technical constraint of this project was to avoid using SVG for graphics or Mermaid JS for diagrams. All visual elements, including the value chain flowchart and SWOT icons, are built using a combination of HTML structure, Tailwind CSS, and standard Unicode characters. This demonstrates a commitment to foundational web technologies and performance.
